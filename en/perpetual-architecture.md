# MCDEX v2 Perpetual Architecture

With the on-chain AMM and off-chain order book running at the same time, MCDEX users have two trading choices:
a. Trade with AMM, which is simple and intuitive.
b. Trade with order book, which is similar to trading Perpetual contract on a centralized exchange.
